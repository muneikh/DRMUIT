# DRMUIT

A sample application to display rewards for eligible customers based on different channel channel descriptions.

The app has two services.

* Rewards: This service returns rewards based on user channel subscriptions.
* Eligibility: This service checks if a certain user is applicable for the rewards.

Both of the services are mocked to demonstrate unit and integration tests.
